# Project 0: TODO App
## Objectives
- Become more comfortable with JS and DOM manipulation.
- Gain experience reading and adding to source code.

## Getting Started
Download the distro code from https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2020/x/projects/0/project0.zip and unzip project0.zip, which should yield a directory called project0.

Then, in a terminal window (located in /Applications/Utilities on Mac or by typing cmd in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted project0 (recall that the cd command can change your current directory), and run

`cd project0`

To get started, follow the directions in your project README.

## FAQs
- Will I be penalized for editing files other than script.js?
    - Nope, feel free to edit the HTML or CSS if you feel like it adds to your app!
- Do I have to worry about browser compatibility?
    - Not at all. As long as your app works on Chrome (or any other browser that you specify), that’s all we’ll be using to test your app.
- Can I use an external library?
    - Please stick to just vanilla JS for this project.
